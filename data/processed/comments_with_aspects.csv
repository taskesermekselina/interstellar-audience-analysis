j3DuONZb3Ik,the movie gives us very little reason to think that the fivedimensional beings are future humans that possibility was completely baseless speculation by cooper there is no evidence whatsoever in the story that he is correct even if the wormhole builders are future humans we dont have a paradox if the eternalist view of time is correct and the movie clearly presumes that eternalism is indeed correct the future humans saving the present humans so that the present humans live long enough to become the future humans is an example of circular causality a causes b then b causes a then a causes b then b causes a and so on the thing is viewed from a fiveplus dimensional perspective the past the present and the future as we call them are all equally real and equally accessible from the fifth dimension event a and event b are basically simultaneous and are both visible on the time curve and here is the real important part there is no version of the time curve in which a and b do not exist no version of the time curve in which a does not cause b and no version in which b does not cause a there is no first play through in which the future did not yet exist to interact with the past according to eternalism the future and the past always exist are always just as real as the present and for five dimensional beings the unchanging past and the unchanging future are just as accessible as the present most scientists say that causality does not work like that and time travel is not possible a minority of scientists say causality does work like this and time travel is possible as long as the past is not changed obviously being a time travel story the movie went with the second explanation in short it might be a mind screw but it is not necessarily a paradox and while there are at least a dozen serious plot holes in this movie the way time travel is handled isnt one of them,0,2023-08-04T21:10:00Z,1,2,story and plot,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,as i saw the film the shock that the aliens are actually highly advance humans it left me wondering where did they come from you spoke how humanity evolved to see and understand all dimensions but yet why was the wormhole and the unknown star system created as the wormhole and black hole are suppose to be artificial created by a unknown alien race likely to save humanity as i recall the real secondary mission was to seed a world with genetic material allowing a second coming of humanity to survive as the gravity theory was a fake story to get get people to work with the idea of hope to ensure that something survived without telling the team and the world they were dying when the gravity knowledge is sent by cooper to his daughter the wormhole closes and suddenly cooper is back in the sol system picked up and taken to the space colonies created by humanity but no sign of the wormhole partly because of the future humans had shutdown the wormhole as humanity did not move to the new world in mass on the other side the project is moving along for the seeding of this new world with life from earth including a second generation of humanity i believe that the humans that would evolve on this world are the ones to set this up to ensure their birth happens as cooper returns to the womans side after being allowed to say goodbye to his daughter the wormhole is opened once more and for the final time as he is part of the plan for this second branch of humanity you might be right about your own theory but it still does not left me thinking about the original nasa mission to seed an alien world with life that originated from earth humanity is living in space colonies instead of making the move to a new world it all points to future humans are the source but it does not mean humans from the sol system this is what left me feeling about seeing that film,0,2020-06-14T20:41:15Z,0,2,ending,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,if the humanity didnt survive because of the lack of food there would be nobody in the future to evolve and open the wormhole if they are us in the future the only reasonable explanations in my eyes would be the humanity sent a different spacecraft taking them thousand or even millions of years to reach a distant planet no wormhole and that mission was a success and somehow this new humanity evolved to be the one to have the technology to save their ancestors coopers humanity so they oppened the wormhole and create the tessarak for cooper in the gargantua but even this would be scketcy as they would risk their own existence because of butterfly effect no reason for them to do it or at least not untill that spacecraft carrying themselves allready left humanity coopers humanity or a little part of it survived the extinction and find a way to open the wormhole back in time and this way roll the entire film plot otherwise is nonsense someone explained it is somekind of a paradox bootstrap paradox and goes like this someone diyng finds a medicine able to cure him and the person who gave him the medicine is himself from the future comming back to plant the medicine in his path how could himself in the future exist have the time to develop the medicine if he dies today nonse same paradox would apply for the last standing man on planet who decides to suicide because of lonlyness and jumps in lava but himself in the furure comes back to cool the volcano and him not to die he is the last man on earth there is no future for humanity so no way for him to continue and then come back,1,2023-02-20T14:28:07Z,0,2,ending,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,i have been watching this movie several time and i have found the exact explanation for this movie nolan is such a genius director and storyteller are u guys get it who are they why cooper is not died from gargantuas gravity why cooper suddenly guided into the tesseract well i have found the answer do you noticed that when cooper was inside tesseract he was talking to tars saying that they are not alien or god or whatever sentient creature we think of they are future humans who have advanced intelligent level and somehow have found technology to manipulate gravity and time i agree with cooper they are actually future human but wait if they are future human sending cooper to save them then how did they survive and live just to send cooper to save humanity it doesnt make any sense right in the future youre perfectly safe and there is nothing to correct anymore take a deep breath and read this with a relieve yup because the future human who saved cooper from gargantua is not the same human that were left on earth with murph they are the new human who were raised by dr emilia brand from the new planet got it i hope you got it when dr emilia brand set foot on new planet she wasnt alone she carry with her some kind of human embryo correct me if im wrong that can restart human population now these new human are them im pretty sure that dr emilia teaches them everything they should know about all the sacrifices been made for them to get where they are until such time she will continue to sleep in her cryo chamber and wait for cooper to come to her because she believe that love will bring cooper to her of course she will try to find cooper because without his sacrifice she cant survive and humanity cant survive as well and remember time in this movie can be manipulated so she send her team to save cooper at the moment when cooper falling into gargantuas gravity core they are dr emilia brand and her new human colony from distant future please give likes and comment thank u people,581,2020-10-26T01:12:56Z,0,2,ending,2

j3DuONZb3Ik,didnt watch this the ending is as simplistic as it is ridiculous future humans figured out how to manipulate gravity so well that they created a wormhole from one point in their ancient past to another so that their ancient ancestors possibly million or even hundreds of millions of years in the past us modern times could learn to manipulate gravity and escape their dying planet to then live on and eventually breed evolve breed evolve into the future humans who setup the wormhole to save them these future decedents of present day humanity are apparently so far beyond us that they cant just send us a letter with the completed formula on it that part isnt actually that far fetched imagine going back in time million years and trying to communicate with one of our genetic ancestors a primate named lucy you cant talk to lucy you dont even understand how she communicates but you understand that she is one of your ancestors one of the ancestors of all modern humans and that she is on the verge of starving to death you see plentiful fruit trees across a small chasm from where lucy is but she cant get there so you build her a bridge and lead her to it she sees the bridge crosses finds the fruit survives breeds and whala humanity now exist because this one individual and therefore all of here potential offspring survive the problem is its ridiculous and stupid this is a time paradox that could never have begun see lucy died and therefore there were no humans and no one to go back in time to show her where the fruit trees were or build a bridge to get there lucy starved to death and humanity never existed the same thing happens in interstellar humanity died on earth unable to get a sufficient population and the needed supplies into space therefore they had no future generations who eventually evolved into super advanced from our perspective beings who could drop a wormhole in the past giving us the ability to save ourselves again no way to start the time loop hollywood is lazy and relies on the ignorance of the general population to never ask the question how did the time loop start instead of a logical plot line they substitute dramatic over amplified music now in the case of lucy there is a way to start the time loop imagine that since lucy died in the original time line humanity never evolved leaving space for perhaps another primate species to evolve since we werent around to hunt them to extinction or simply compete with them for food and land so this other primate species evolves technologically to the point they can travel back in time and do so to perhaps investigate the origins of their own species one of the expedition members comes across and almost starved lucy and feeling pity gives here a protein bar some water and drops a log across a nearby chasm allowing her access to fruit trees now lucy survives humanity is eventually born destroying the emergence of the very species that helped her to survive this could create a time loop where earth at the very least is stuck in those few hundred million years over and over this would be a sort of a grandfather paradox where the scientist from another species goes back in time ultimately preventing his own existence but then doesnt exist in the future to go back in time to make that mistake this could be resolved however if a human decedent of lucy in the future then goes back in time to find lucy almost starved himself and takes similar action to cause her survival now the mistake of the scientist from the other species is no longer needed and the timeline can progress the reason this wouldnt work in interstellar is that the entire earth was dying all live would be gone in very short order so if humans didnt survive there certainly wouldnt be time for any other species to evolve technologically far beyond us in just a few decades also as far as the movie is concerned there never were any aliens they thought aliens had something to do with it but again it was human decedents from the distant future so if humans died on earth that was it game over there is no possibility based on anything in the movie for the time loop to begin let alone be resolved in a way that would allow the time line to progress beyond the loop if you didnt understand this dont worry just stare at interstellar with the blank faced grin of a child who loves fireworks and has no idea the chemistry of how or why they work,0,2021-10-01T18:06:45Z,0,2,ending,0

zSWdZVtXT7E,i dont understand why people find it hard to believe the reasoning behind us being an interstellar traveling species during the existence of the earth there have been over a handful of mass extinctions caused by different things we have the technology and the means to survive some things but the odds are that we will eventually have to just leave the planet lets say we find a way to prevent all those things the sun is not going to last forever perfecting interstellar travel is the only way we can truly survive as a species the ability to pick up our things and move to a different location is our only true means of survival and you wouldnt want it to be the last thing you do before something catastrophic occurs chances are by then it is too late,2,2014-06-20T05:44:01Z,0,2,ending,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,i dont get the concept of time goes faster here than there i know that time is relative and i know its a madeup concept but its still physically a thing most clocks in the world will countdown exactly in the same way because everything on earth is relatively the exact same in regards to environment but then a wild physics zealot appears people can time travel so hes on the planet and apparently their body seems to function fine which means that on an atomic level there is no hyperactivity which means that if he got a wristwatch it would physically do the same thing relatively speaking the atoms would move at the same speed making the clock tick at the same speed and not only that even if he by some magical means gets years older relatively speaking and just year has passed on earth that doesnt mean the same amount of time didnt pass relatively to an objective source he still spent year on that planet relative to earth and likewise years went by on earth relative to him it doesnt make sense to me to separate these facts like some magic can someone explain to me if this relative time theory is the magical theory so many use that they could come back and just have aged year and their family died years ago the aging process in a human being is unstoppable if you can exist you must be in an environment that allows you to exist and as such cant be supernatural because its natural that you live and every physical process that allow you to function normally and as such wont age faster or slower than you would on earth it is that thought i just cant accept i also get the concept of potentially travelling faster than light but that just means for an observer what youd observe is something that has already happened for the subject travelling faster than light so i dont quite get the concept of time travelling using wormholes in theory either is there any way physics in observeable dimensions could interact with a human body at all to hasten or slow the aging process and concious interpretation of time without the subject noticing any difference hence oh what years passed we all know the oh was i asleep for just minutes i thought ive slept for an hour but come on im really open to mostly everything but ive yet to see or hear an explanation about time being a farce and completely subjective to gravitys whim and it not being relative to our consciousness at all that doesnt seem to be some i just disovered pluto is not a planet rambling thanks if you read all this and i dont really expect to get any particular attention but i needed to write it its been annoying me for a good while and nobody seems to be able to explain or they cant be arsed i like to think im trying to view stuff from different angles but that is truly relative,0,2018-03-05T15:18:06Z,0,2,science and physics,1
BHsFzDON6pA,i agree with much of this i believed the science and thats quite a nice touch for someone who doesnt know shit about astrophysics or whatever field this was about ppl say it was building towards a big emotional ending that it never quite produces but i feel that it was going for the big emotional punch midway through when cooper gets the cache of videos from his family learning he has a grandkid and that it died all in the same moment and that his kids have given up on him its a heartwrenching scene with cooper having a very believable crying breakdown one of the best ive ever seen in a film i feel that was the peak of the films emotional mountain weve been climbing and then we come back down through a climactic ending to a less albeit still impactful emotional ending a from me,0,2019-10-12T22:57:09Z,0,1,emotional impact,2

qhW1HfSuPVQ,alright i will agree with your assessment of the film except for his reasons for leaving his daughter at the end its not that she would rather be with her new family and doesnt need her father anymore the whole film is essentially about how love transcends space and time and is the driving force for every ones actions she says no parent should have to watch their child die i think thats pretty much it theyve spent the majority of her life separate from each other and rather him seeing her and then her just dying they part ways having reunited her acknowledging that he never abandoned her had every intention of saving her and the world and loves her more than anything so while yes she did make peace with him having been gone for so long she didnt send him away because she didnt want him she sent him away for him and for the world so he could go to bran sp and help her on the new planet in a way it kind of reflects the growth she has made where when she was a child she didnt want him to leave and then refused to contact him for years until her rd birthday but then after she has lived her life and made peace she can understand his decision and actually wants him to help it shows growth and love so anyway i loved your video youre funny just wanted to put my two cents in,0,2014-11-18T02:41:16Z,0,2,ending,1

BHsFzDON6pA,indeed all theoretical which can be entirely wrong as well i watched the doc particle fever about the large hadron collider and their results ultimately went to an extent against the believed upon theory that the experiment was testing besides concluding that the higgs boson particle existed they also dive into a whole other spectrum of how if the results came out a certain way it would turn theories upside down so its not necessarily irresponsible for nolan to take liberty with some of the theoretical stuff of the film after all a lot of confirmed scientific truths initially were considered pseudoscience before they were validated many years later the universe does some strange shit,0,2014-11-06T12:48:09Z,1,2,science and physics,0

zSWdZVtXT7E,vik c nobody saw a wormhole no one yet proved its shape hell no body proved it even exists all these are physics theories but if you really want to know why they used circular shape maybe because of alcubierre drive which is a theory of reason behind warp travel in this theory the spaceship contracts space in front of it and expands space behind it which can be used to travel faster than light without experiencing gforce so maybe the space ship in the trailer contracts the space in front of it or they did it with some kinda device making it a circular shape,0,2014-06-12T13:55:26Z,1,2,visual effects and CGI,1

BHsFzDON6pA,the future humans had become so advanced that they moved beyond the th dimension the one we live in which consists of the dimensions of length width depth and time what happened is that cooper was placed into the th dimension black holes basically break physics so at that point we dont really know what would happen if someone actually went through one now the th dimensions is basically too complex for humans to understand its like if a being who lived on piece of paper acting as the nd length and width suddenly lived in our dimension they would not be able to comprehend the ideas of depth and time because they simply were not made that way also theoretically a being in the th dimension would be able to travel through time just as we can walk forward backward up and down now according to science if something from the th dimension were to appear infront of you what you would see is a hyper cube its like a strange cube made of cubes because that is the simplest way we could understand it and even then it may not look right to us and i believe the future humans were showing coop previous events in time and with their power were able to make him send those messages thats the problem of this film and i fucking love this film it doesnt explain any of this complex science shit and just assumes you know stuff already i did which let me enjoy it so much more,0,2017-01-21T06:31:54Z,1,2,visual effects and CGI,0

j3DuONZb3Ik,thats a really good question actually i was kind of confused why they were on an oneil cylinder as well i think it might have partially been so that the audience could better understand that they were on a space station and to make it look more scientific also theres no telling what mastering gravity really entails assuming it gives them the ability to control and ignore it by launching giant things weightlessly into space then it would also mean they could easily make artificial gravity mastering gravity would also make it easier to achieve some form of ftl if you could control gravity then you would be able to artificially bend space time around yourself look up the alcubierre warp drive its a realistic ftl theory in which you contract the space time in front of you and expand it behind you in a warp bubble which makes you go faster than light without actually going faster than light,1,2021-09-27T18:45:48Z,1,2,science and physics,2

BHsFzDON6pA,the music keeps you stand by you never knows when to expect a pleasant moment or a tragedy and yet you are as lost as the characters are as submitted to their fate which is controlled by the very little facts that they know compared to what there really are well guess what i have never cried for a movie never but literally wept during the joyful and sad scenes during this one i agree that in few or moments the movie was extra convenient but you know what maybe it was the right dosage but was extensive at the latter part of the movie think about it i couldnt blink an eye during the whole time was observing them going through disappointments during the first hours and my emotions and all of my senses got exhausted waiting for a result was feeling as empty and helpless cooper should have felt when he was watching his sons growing up messages i thought about the moment when he could almost ignore his fathers death while listening to his own son grieving on his infant grandson all of these interactions in addition to the smoothness of accepting the assumptions of the scifi environment made me feel like areal life witness on all of what ive seen in the movie i believed the sadness and cried felt delightful about the success and grateful for the lucky destiny of cooper in the end of the film is it a or b or even c i dont know but if i was the scale you people shouldnt compare it with or grade it among percent of the other hollywood movies,0,2020-01-19T00:53:37Z,0,1,emotional impact,2

j3DuONZb3Ik,i asked a similar question in another video time was relative to where they were and both would perceive it the same way though time on that water planet was actually moving faster my best guess is although they didnt physically age but only a couple of hours or so that technically they were yrs older once they met up with their friend in space and shared the same time relativity to earth it appears to be somewhat of a time travel since its the same timeline and theyre the only copy of themselves they should be older without the physical appearance of aging time moved faster for them but they only perceived a couple of hours passing relative to what theyre used to on earth time i think theyre older but didnt age due to time perception thats the best i can come up with,1,2021-09-28T23:42:49Z,1,2,story and plot,1

BHsFzDON6pA,dont know about you guys but interstellar was easily the best film ive seen this decade and is imo the best nolan film ever yes i rate it much higher than the dark knight and thats saying something along with return of the king it was my best cinema experience so i must respectfully say i completely agree with what flaws you think there are in this film the film does not have a script issue honestly think youre saying that to try and poke at the film cause theres nothing else to the narrative is simple the context however is complicated for some people because interstellar explores science that cinema has never been before and how can you say the ending didnt have an emotional punch brands theory of love and how it truly had relevance to d world,25,2015-03-26T23:24:06Z,0,1,ending,2

qhW1HfSuPVQ,james f sorry if its a little long but i felt it was necessary to give you a proper answer its one of my favorite paradoxes it is called the bootstrap paradox doctor who explained this paradox well imagine i have all of beethovens original music sheets and i can time travel so as much as a i love beethoven i want to get his work signed i go back in time when beethoven should be well known but i discover that know one knows who beethoven is i come to the conclusion he doesnt exist and begin orchestrating his symphonies never meeting beethoven now obviously i become beethoven in my timeline but who was the original beethoven my theory on this is that there once was in the original timeline a beethoven but when i first go back in time i dont meet him and i create his music which in turn erases the original timeline obviously this paradox occurs when time travel is introduced in which it becomes a set point in history i will always obtain beethovens original sheets of music i will always go back in time to have him sign his work and i will always orchestrate his music so to answer your question somehow humans survive the blight and discover th dimensional travel once they do though instead of letting time and themselves take their original course of action they decided to go back in time and create a new timeline which is the one where interstellar takes place i hope this made some sense,76,2016-08-01T07:33:28Z,1,2,science and physics,2

j3DuONZb3Ik,honkhonk so whats the difference with space then theres nothing to save in space basically theres nothing at all while at the earth they had constructing materals resources place gravity air water etc etc this part of script is sooo wrong they could choose any other variant which implies some kind of danger in case they stayed there but they chose oh theres nothing left except about tons of resources construction materials energy sources minerals metals whatever nah we gonna go into space wheee so ridiculous what prevented them from buiding the same kind of stuff they used for spacesips but without sending it to space which would be like million times easier the same freaking isolated hermetic spaces like they had in their spaceships if they chose some kind of heavy radiation for a plot that would do but they chose some kind of plague even at current level of technology we can protect ourselves from any organisms biohazard teams use totally hermetic places so its not just microorganizms but even gas moleculas cant penetrate it in the worst case like if earth would become vulcanically superactive for example they could stay at the orbit of earth or we have moon by the way building something on some solid structure is million times easier than building stuff in space i love this movie and becuse of this im mad at this poor plot like years old kid could come up with a better reason for people to leave the planet,0,2020-08-30T03:09:03Z,1,2,science and physics,0

j3DuONZb3Ik,the movie gives us very little reason to think that the fivedimensional beings are future humans that possibility was completely baseless speculation by cooper there is no evidence whatsoever in the story that he is correct word of advice prefacing a baseless claim with the rhetorical question dont you see does not actually make the claim more credible this is especially true if you are talking to a robot who is far more likely to recognize an argument by assertion fallacy than your typical human nolan fan would even if the wormhole builders are future humans we dont have a paradox if the eternalist view of time is correct and the movie clearly presumes that eternalism is indeed correct the future humans saving the present humans so that the present humans live long enough to become the future humans is an example of circular causality a causes b then b causes a then a causes b then b causes a and so on the thing is viewed from a fiveplus dimensional perspective the past the present and the future as we call them are all equally real and equally accessible from the fifth dimension event a and event b are basically simultaneous and are both visible on the time curve and here is the real important part there is no version of the time curve in which a and b do not exist no version of the time curve in which a does not cause b and no version in which b does not cause a there is no first play through in which the future did not yet exist to interact with the past according to eternalism the future and the past always exist are always just as real as the present and for five dimensional beings the unchanging past and the unchanging future are just as accessible as the present most scientists say that causality does not work like that and time travel is not possible a minority of scientists say causality does work like this and time travel is possible as long as the past is not changed obviously being a time travel story the movie went with the second explanation in short it might be a mind screw but it is not necessarily a paradox and while there are at least a dozen serious plot holes in this movie the way time travel is handled isnt one of them,0,2023-08-04T21:02:52Z,1,2,ending,1

BHsFzDON6pA,spoilers i really liked the first half maybe quarters of the film but there was a point in the movie you might know what point i am talking about where the whole suspension of disbelief was thrown out the window it became ridiculous really fast and i personally do not think it was needed if you havent seen the movie spoilers ahead the part i am talking about is of course when the main character goes into a black hole and finds the singularity can warp gravity whatever seriously what is up with this the whole point of this was so that he can make the coordinates in the beginning with the dust and a ghost thing i just dont think that is enough to justify the black hole part he couldve found the coordinates somehow else or even more logically been reached by nasa for being a great pilot and all i doubt they would spend so much money on a rocket just to find that no one could fly it you may say that i just dont understand the complexity but to be honest it just doesnt work i love when movies can get complicated source code did a great job because the surprise ending made sense in the world source code built in interstellar we get the wormholes yes but those are hypothetical so suspension of disbelief works as far as the wormholes go but nothing about a singularity opening dimensions make sense and the explanation that a future civilization did it it kinda bad writing i loved the movie up until that point i was at the edge of my seat it was fun it was great but as soon as he entered that black hole damn i was pissed off im not going to lie,0,2014-11-09T08:44:56Z,0,2,visual effects and CGI,0

BHsFzDON6pA,the dimensional beings brought cooper all this way for lyk years and you honestly think he should have been lost or something they are dimensional beings who can whip up a wormhole and a tesseract in a black hole im pretty sure they can get him back home after all the audience roots for him to get back home leaving coopers fate ambiguous would not only go against the movies theme but would also be a rehash of inception lyk the films arent similar enough already brooding widower separated from his children and must get back to them but must first venture to realities where time dilates sometimes it doesnt hurt to wrap things up and not always play the ambiguity gimmick you can have only so much ambiguous endings before you become a shaymalan,0,2016-05-22T00:18:04Z,1,2,ending,1

BHsFzDON6pA,i give it a b or out of for similar reason the ending is a result of the flaw of the core philosophy and critical scientific misunderstanding that is in the center of the film the daughter character and matthews character are very powerful in the movie and hathaway character is likable but the plots are too cheap and too predictable and story was just deeply flawed to begin with,0,2015-04-13T22:01:55Z,0,1,ending,0

qhW1HfSuPVQ,ok so what i gather is that brand who was seen on the planet alone executed plan b these humans over the next million years which we dont see because in higher dimensions the th dimension time is not linear and all events in all of time are happening simultaneously developed ways to interact with these higher dimensions they knew that the real way for humanity to survive was by executing plan a however if cooper sacrificed himself to the black hole then plan a would never work so the future humans finished the research from a million years ago and figured out how to interact with the past by creating the tesseract thus saving cooper from his ultimate death in gargantua cooper came to the realization that it was future humans who created the tesseract so he could relay information back to murph being in a d representation of the th dimension he was able to locate and communicate with murph since cooper ensured plan a was successful the timeline with plan b was no longer viable the future humans knew that by executing plan a cooper would be altering the future thus deleting the th dimensional humans from existence in its entirety thats why cooper was able to escape the tesseract it collapsed because cooper saved humanity through plan a and therefore the tesseract no longer existed the entire paradox within the movie was closed because the future humans sacrificed themselves to save humanity plan a was successful and humanity lives happily ever after on brands planet,979,2015-10-13T13:27:11Z,0,2,ending,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,this movie isnt confusing to anyone who knows a bit about relativity this should be taught in schools already what makes me dislike this movie is this entire murphdadlove story that ruins the scientific background and feel of the film and the major huge plot holes in it no intelligent scientist would ever consider any planet close to a black hole as habitable the last planet they went to was their only real choice from the beginning on why cant the futures humans tell them directly what to do and where to go they overcomplicated everything and basically just hoped he would go into the black hole aka tesseract how does the communication from the tesseract to any relative point in time really work i mean the thing with the clock that was utter nonsens and to clear things up the fact that humanity needs to send help from the future to prolong their existence into the future to survive to save themselves in the past isnt a paradox pers its just our lack of understanding of time and relativity,1,2016-07-21T13:55:41Z,0,2,visual effects and CGI,0

j3DuONZb3Ik,the movie gives us very little reason to think that the fivedimensional beings are future humans that possibility was completely baseless speculation by cooper there is no evidence whatsoever in the story that he is correct even if the wormhole builders are future humans we dont have a paradox if the eternalist view of time is correct and the movie clearly presumes that eternalism is indeed correct the future humans saving the present humans so that the present humans live long enough to become the future humans is an example of circular causality a causes b then b causes a then a causes b then b causes a and so on the thing is viewed from a fiveplus dimensional perspective the past the present and the future as we call them are all equally real and equally accessible from the fifth dimension event a and event b are basically simultaneous and are both visible on the time curve and here is the real important part there is no version of the time curve in which a and b do not exist no version of the time curve in which a does not cause b and no version in which b does not cause a there is no first play through in which the future did not yet exist to interact with the past according to eternalism the future and the past always exist are always just as real as the present and for five dimensional beings the unchanging past and the unchanging future are just as accessible as the present most scientists say that causality does not work like that and time travel is not possible a minority of scientists say causality does work like this and time travel is possible as long as the past is not changed obviously being a time travel story the movie went with the second explanation in short it might be a mind screw but it is not necessarily a paradox and while there are at least a dozen serious plot holes in this movie the way time travel is handled isnt one of them,0,2023-08-04T21:28:17Z,1,2,story and plot,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,here is a comment of mine from another interstellar vid im going to play a little devils advocate and say that cooper didnt survive the blackhole and that gravity did tear him apart one can argue that the wormhole wasnt placed there by them that it was just a naturallyoccurring phenomenon once cooper travels past the event horizon on the otherside of the wormhole its plausible that its his vision of the afterlife its not the future that he is experiencing but he is experiencing heaven christopher nolan plays on this idea of love and certain religious symbolism throughout the entirety of the film therefore you could argue that what is being presented as the future of humanity in the film is coopers view of the afterlife since he is experiencing heaven this is why he sees baseball being played his house is there and finally sees murph new members of his family these things may not be certain bits of the future but memories interwoven into his afterlife experience now do i believe my own hypothesis no but i think there is enough evidence to argue that its a plausible theory,6,2016-06-28T16:54:52Z,1,2,visual effects and CGI,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,an interesting theory about this movie is that its all a loop and i dont see many people talking about it so i will give my take on it so the loop theory basically implies that since cooper is communicating from the future into the past in order to save humanity the whole fate of mankind is stuck in a loop the loop goes like this humanity is dying so a wormhole placed by people from the future appears to help humanity from going extinct the wormhole makes a future for humanity possible and when humantiy reaches a future in which they understand the fifth dimension they can go back in time and place a wormhole to save themselves so the problem with the theory that its all a loop is that the loop cant start let me explain cooper comes to the conclusion that future humans who have figured out how the five dimensions work were the ones that placed the wormhole but in order for humanity to reach a future were they understand the fifth dimension they would need to solve the problem of earth becoming uninhabitable and to do this they would need a way to travel to a new habitable planet they would need a wormhole starting to see the problem in order for the wormhole to exist it needs to have already existed humanity needs the wormhole in order to reach a future were they can create the wormhole i have yet to find a solution to this problem and until someone does i think the true explanation of the film will remain a mystery if anyone can explain this please give it a go,0,2022-11-08T17:13:28Z,0,2,clarity and complexity,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,jshaw warning lots of text to follow well that would be the unknown portion that no theory hascan explain we know humans were dangerously close to extinction in our time and we know that humans of the future graduated to a higher plane of existence but thats all we know how they attained godlike powers is anyones guess i only propose that instead of d humans being earth born which causes a huge paradox that they were space colonists i have no hypothesis for how they evolved im sure given enough time the scientific method would yield great results maybe given enough time all organisms could unlock the secrets of the cosmos and level up to dimensions above our the reasoning for my colonist hypothesis is it seems to not cause an infinite loop paradox i thought it was almost an oversight how they shoehorned a second clip at the very end of the movie showing brand in the process of colonizing her planet i felt the short clip was delivered in such a way as to hint to the possibility that cooper wasnt the only hero it not only seems to resolve the paradox but also promotes brands character to actually being central to the overall story i think it was a deliberate decision to not focus on brand after the black hole scene to make the audience forget the colonists and focus on cooper for the express purpose of a semiopen ended story this is why i love movies like this the usual suspects the thirteenth floor blade runner any kubrick film etc because they drop hints that point to one possible logical conclusion but never actually divulge the truth it sparks all kinds of great debates and ideas that live in our minds long after the end credits i liked the movie when i saw it but after contemplating possible answers to the paradox i can say i now love this movie,55,2014-11-18T16:59:22Z,1,2,clarity and complexity,1

BHsFzDON6pA,i think whether you liked the movie or not depends upon your understanding of physics and the relation between gravitational force and time this movie explores the theory of general relativity very well the use of gravity time dilation in the way the astronauts dont age as time becomes slower for them due to the increasing gravitational force of the planets is incredible the working of a wormhole is also beautifully and accurately shown the depiction of how a black hole looks from the outside is accurate as hell and a sight to behold the use of centrifugal force to produce g so that the astronauts can walk inside the spacecraft normally is clever the use of consevation of momentum to provide gravitational assist to the spacecraft to escape the black hole thats all real physics i was so much invested in the movie because right now im pursuing a masters degree in theoretical physics and to see a movie depict all of those complex concepts of physics so fluidly and beautifully was more than enough for making me love the movie now about the end of the movie we still dont know for sure whats inside a black hole what we do know is that black holes the rotating ones might act as some sort of teleporting devices by bending the curvature of spacetime so that could explain how he managed to reach back to our solar system however we know that a person would never be able to survive the journey to the centre of the black hole since the enormous gravitational force would squeeze him like a spaghetti but still no one hasent gone into a black hole so we dont know for sure what happens inside it thats why im fine with what they showed at the end of the film because although we dont know what will happen if we go inside a black hole it is generally accepted among physicists that whatever happens inside it its bizarre as hell nevertheless this film is a treat to watch because seeing all these complex and mysterious phenomena on the big screen and that too so accurately depicted along with the great cast realistic acting astounding visual effects mesmerising music and awesome direction is more than enough for me to call this movie a masterpiece,7,2020-06-03T08:11:29Z,0,1,visual effects and CGI,2
j3DuONZb3Ik,is what i dont understand the future humans with their dimensional world can only exist if they have the gravity equation solved but cooper did that so before all the loops sometimes the future humans had to find out the equation without cooper because they had to start this loop of helping their past human comrades so it startet with coincidences thats what i dont get feel free to explain it to me,0,2022-08-04T10:52:33Z,0,2,science and physics,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,at present we believe the world exists in dimensions length breath and height there is a theory named string theory that says that actually there are or dimensions since we cannot comprehend this string theory is yet to be experimentally proven but it says that time exists as a fourth physical dimension ie similar to the weird world cooper finds himself in in the movie like you can change it stretch extend etc like you can with length breadth and height so if we can prove string theory to be true all sorts of cool things like wormholes and time travel could actually happen in our universe so time is a physical dimension here which is why an hour is years on millers planet also black holes actually exist as shown in the movie irl except that nobody has ever gone into one and you cant see it in visible lightthey are complex and fascinating things however fun fact alternate universes could exist as well if string theory holds good hope this was helpful,2,2019-03-24T11:03:28Z,0,2,science and physics,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,pausing at after the glossing over of it being theoretically possible to pass through a wormhole there is no theory that holds that material from one side of a wormhole could pass through to the other side in the same form information from one side would be invariably transformed by passing through the wormhole unless there was some miraclulous gravity resistant device that could keep a ship matter people organisms intact by going through the wormhole thats because a wormhole is not an end in itself but derived from the possibility that black holes can some how be a wormhole of some kind which is to say that there has to be a black hole in one spacetime and another in a different spacetime and they have to be interdimensionally connected but there is no knowing where the other black holewormhole is it is also unlikely that a wormhole can be moved and it is also unlikely that its destination can be known because all matter and information passing through gets transformed ie all persons organisms spaceships passing through would be crushed into a blob of pussy borg remains and then passing back through by some miracle they would then go through the blender again also there has been a lot of credulous speculation about passing through wormholes in scischlockfi but no one seems interested in the concept that getting stuck in one by the immense gravity problem is glaring them in the face i know it wouldnt work as a plot point which is why wormholes are not plausible this is why nasa is working on a warp drive,1,2014-12-23T04:17:49Z,0,2,visual effects and CGI,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,the scenes of the spinning spaceship reminded me that old people like me should never get on a roller coaster again when the crewman asked for dramamine i wanted to ask for some too that being said it is hard to understand how humans from the future and in a whole other galaxy were able to send a worm hole back in time so that the earlier humans had a chance to survive if the future humans actually are our offspring which came first the chicken or the egg maybe they are a different set of humans not related to earth one thing i noticed in particular was the new earth colony which may have existed around saturn that colony had the appearance of being created in the shape of a torus also very imaginative now i have to wonder what a torus would look like in a dimensional universe all said and done i think this movie was much like contact in that it kept me thinking about it long after i saw it like a favorite song you cant get out of your head doesnt have to follow science exactly just has to open our minds to new possibilities i think it is an awesome movie definitely go see it oh and if you go to the theater i saw it in bring some ear plugs my popcorn was vibrating right out of the bag,0,2014-12-02T20:49:22Z,0,2,science and physics,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,if your intelligence is over the average viewer you mostly will think its not that windblown in my opinion the movie was interesting but also a bit stupid they could have made a better and more realistic crisis to earth than dust flowing around a global warming volcanic explosion even a zombie apocalypse would be better there was an interesting start but not to advanced to understand the world is dying find a new world thats when i asked my self my take a shot with a random planet with no info other than come here from drmann why not rather go for making a base at mars later in they come to a planet of water then one of the astronauts just stands there watching here friend far away from the spaceshipthen ending up duying cause he just stood there watching her being rescued that was just stupid and then in the end copper tries to warn drmann by telling him not to open the gate why didnt he just say it would blow up cause the robot have reconfigured it that way and in the end cooper found this th dimension planet that made no sense he landed on it with at hyperspeed and didnt get hurt at at then he could see his daughers room and threw down books and make the clockwise tick back and fourth in the room thats impossible and stupid if he could move physical things like books then his voice should also have been received cause its also a thingsoundwave and if you dont get understand that why could he just have moved a pencil inside the room and make the pencil drew letters with the information and remember years on earth is hour on the planet with the girl so if cooper spend some years on earth before he went to the new planet it still wouldt have taken him longer than hour before he was back on the weird planet where the girl was making camp anyone else think the movie was overrated and not that smart,0,2014-11-12T01:22:27Z,0,2,ending,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,in this film there is no paradox nor are there parallel universes this is a causal loop an example thorneyoung is about to write his next book about traveling through time but before he took the pen someone knocks at the door is thorneold who has come from the future he gives thorneyoung the thornes book already written thorneyoung very grateful send the book to the editorial and sold many copies a few years later thorne returns to the past and gives to thorne the thornes finished book in the story there are no contradictions no paradoxes the story is consistent each event is explained from the previous event but who wrote the book neither thorneyoung nor thorneold wrote it likewise who created the wormhole where did the information come from the loop is selfexplanatory but it is impossible to find an explanation from causes external to it the information did not come from nowhere it was always there murphys law doesnt mean that something bad will happen it means that whatever can happen will happen more information search novikov selfconsistency principle nolan shows what could have been a paradox the coopers future from the tesseract retaining cooper from the past in the room of her daughter this really would be a paradox cooper would never have started the journey so he could not be in the tesseract but it did not happen because the paradoxes never happen,1,2014-11-20T18:33:33Z,0,2,story and plot,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,its not that love is the answer to everything the point is that the strength of the love between cooper murph is such that he can predict she will take a specific action in the future that is she will remember him remember the one physical gift he left her his watch his promise that hed return and so she would return for that watch then seeing the watch tick backwards in a known pattern would have her try to remember that pattern as when cooper has taught her and that would have her realize the other patterns he was leaving her as clues thruout her life as the ghost together those series of patterns proved that he had in fact returned was trying to talk to her her love for him have her the push she needed to believe in the impossible in the first place,2,2020-08-05T01:46:35Z,1,2,ending,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,they future humans had already found a way to survive they had had to leave the planet the planet must have become uninhabitable at some point of time in the past so as they moved on to their next habitat a new generation must have started blossoming back at planet earth possibly us and then for a second time the planet faced extinction in the form of blight and hence they helped humanity through cooper so they possibly are the early civilizations the egyptians the mayans the incas the indus valley people yada yada yada this also ties in quite neatly with the aforementioned civilizations sudden and abrupt disappearances because to think that they belonged to the same time period as that of ours is absurd because if they had already managed to survive why were they monitoring the past to fix their situation they had already survived perhaps this was something that movie tried to allude to but wasnt taken any significant note of by the audience,0,2020-04-11T12:51:42Z,0,2,ending,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,he had nothing left to do on the planet he said it himself he was not interested in the past but wanted to see what is next and where we are going murph told him to go look for brand she buried him at the end she was crying then took off her helmet she would be alone it was further way from the singularity both edmunds miller and mann gave the thumbs up that their planets were good a miller died but the time difference meant they were receiving an old message when miller first touched down on the planet that is why they knew water was there and wanted to go there b mann lied he knew his planet was inhabitable but did not want to die alone c edmunds was furthest away and gave good readings but edmunds had stopped sending messages they did not want to waste fuel because they wanted to return back and they also believed manns lies so they went manns planet second brand gave two reasons to go to edmunds planet one scientific and one based on love people focus on the love part of brands reason and not the fact that edmunds planet would more likely be better because of its distance from the singularity she said that the closer planets would have too many events that can aid evolution be sucked into gargantuas pull closer to the singularity yes time was slower both brand and cooper are over he did not need to get there in time while in the th dimension he was able to relay the quantum data to murph when she was in her room which is one of the places gravitational anomalies occurred at nasa said they started popping up years ago it seems like humans from the future are helping out people in the past which is a part of the plot throughout the movie i notice people only have a problem with this when cooper goes into the black hole he does not know but if he gets her the equation then there is no need for plan b but plan b could still go into effect whenever dr brand starts it professor brand promised to work on the equation while they worked on plan a he could not finish it without the data from a black hole which murph was given by cooper yeah something around that age yes because murph got the data only years later she was when she got the data and finished the equation she is old and have had been in cryogenic sleep when cooper was found at the end i dont know if they are right next to it then they could travel through it pilots were prepping space ships at the end that is what cooper stole it looked like they spent years building a space station in space we have never built space stations and placed them near saturn how long should that take,3,2014-11-16T00:45:01Z,1,2,ending,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,this doesnt make sense though as much as i want it to i have had this issue with the movie ever since i have seen it while i do really enjoy it the time travel just cant work hear me out if they is the group from edmunds planet then it is impossible because it was they that put the wormhole there to allow them to reach those planets well they could never have reached those planets in the first place to advance far enough to be able to put a worm hole there right i mean we as a people originally from earth are dying yet there is a wormhole out there that will allow us to reach further distances that in turn lets us solve the issue of gravity and gives the ability to save our kind on earth but the only way we are ever able to reach it is this wormhole so the only way that wormhole to exist is if it comes from a source other than people that were ever on earth we couldnt have ever reached edmunds planet without the wormhole so how could it be possible that edmunds planet advances and then decides to help the people on earth from the past with this being said the only way the movie makes sense is if whoever they are is an extraterritorial form of live that never derived from a human past that we know,4,2020-03-27T07:28:00Z,1,2,ending,0

qhW1HfSuPVQ,this is a very entertaining explanation video for sure but the movie has even deeper esoteric occult meanings as well in fact it is my opinion that the one single purpose of the movie is to relay the message that lovegravity which is true on the quantum level all the way to galaxies and universes anyone who is well down their path to spiritual enlightenment should play connect the dots and draw parallel lines connecting divine intuition and synchronicity then pair them up with the events in the end of the movie knowing that lovegravity it is love that allows the father to communicate through time and space and it allows the daughter to project her love and concerns through time and space the other way,1,2025-01-16T00:11:53Z,0,1,visual effects and CGI,2
j3DuONZb3Ik,i agree i especially enjoyed that he thought the station was named after him lol the only thing that sucked for me in the movie was bringing love in as a force that somehow interacts with gravity and ugh audiences love when a director adds love as the magic ingredient that saves someone or even humanity if i directed it i would be tempted to use that cheesy unscientific ending too the alternative is not as appealing to dumb morons that make up most of the public i gave up on most of humanity about years ago i only recently got the nerve to state it publicly,40,2020-06-01T06:15:34Z,1,1,ending,0

BHsFzDON6pA,truthfully the movie made me want to do something else while watching it at some points it gripped me in but most of the time it was narrative that didnt really work well together and some other scenes which didnt quite make sense as opposed to the meaning the movie was trying to convey the daughter father thing was only lightly looked at and didnt really pull us in enough to pull through any sort of emotion for the characters bonds besides why is the father daughter and not the son such as a few times he comes close to death but instead of picturing his grandparent son and daughter he only pictures him and his daughter i am sure there are reasons behind this is how the son seems much more happier and not so torn up about dad leaving graphics absolutely stunning i didnt see it in thearter but i am sure it would of been exception if so sound brought on some great atmosphere but there were points where i felt some different music or some music at all would of been needed story the story should of been conveyed better as it sometimes lacked the proper scenes narrative to actually make sense of the story and there really was only one main point to the story survival of the human race as the old earth had too much dust and would wipe out the human kind but overall i thought that the story itself was actually decent as it fit the movie well but perhaps narrative script they had all the right actors but somehow it just didnt feel right i felt as though if your going to say stuff like its all for the human race ect that has feels slightly clich because of it not being backed up enough as we dont really know the characters that well we only have a slight overview of some of them overall the movie is a good watch it has some good and some bad points it is strong in areas like the stunning and beautiful graphics but i feel as though the narrative and story kind of let it down i mean some scenes didnt quite connect either such as where the son hits the man checking out his kids and says you need to leave now or you may die i mean why hit him it serves no purpose and besides that point there are some other parts such as the movie is really about exploration and seeing the solar system or at least that is the purpose i perceived from it i mean if its about space make it about space and not so much about other purposes one last thing why do the humans in the future decide to save the humans in the past sorry i mean the th dimensional i mean if something has already happened why try and change it i mean if they changed it it could wipe out their entire existence and change so many other things so perhaps i didnt quite understand the hole purpose of why the decided to go back and help them anyhow its a good movie and worth a watch runtime hours minutes sorry for the quick review i simply typed this out and am not going to the bother of fixing out any mistakes i may have made,2,2015-04-24T12:49:55Z,0,1,emotional impact,0

j3DuONZb3Ik,the idea i got from the scenes inside the black hole is this when you pass the event horizon all paths lead to the singularity at no point is it possible to get further away from the singularity or even to remain at a constant distance from it this means that the dimension of space in the direction of the singularity becomes timelike so time as experienced outside the black hole must become spacelike this means that he can move back and forth through time in the same manner he normally could through a given dimension of space at least for as long as he has before he becomes spaghettified by proximity to the singularity which is his inescapable future so the library inside the black hole to me represented universal time as a spacelike dimension in which he could move at will because his formerly spacelike path to the singularity had become his axis of time this is what enabled him to travel back in time to his daughters childhood and leave the message stay on her bookshelf before he was crushed by the singularity,1,2022-11-16T08:41:55Z,0,2,visual effects and CGI,1

BHsFzDON6pA,interstellar ending spoiler i loved the ending for interstellar i cried times during the film i teared up when coop was leaving planet earth and cried when cooper watched the videos when brand passes away and the ending when murphy is a grandma on her death bed but the whole point of the ending with coop finding amelia was to prove that amelia was right all along she was right to look for edmunds rather than mann because edmunds has found a hospitable planet so if christopher nolan left that out then the film wouldnt have been complete and wouldnt have the perfect happy ending i personally didnt believe that the film suffered from pacing problems because the whole point was to race against time therefore he needed to be quick my only issue was that i would have loved to see cooper interact more with his family grandchildren and greatgrandchildren during the end throughout the whole film he was eager to return to his family but it felt rushed when he didnt even glimpse at his grandchildren i can understand why to hasten the ending but i wanted to see at least a handshake or a hug or hey look thats your greatgrandpa kids but amazing film my mind is blown and i didnt find much issues with it however i wouldnt want to see it again because the suspense wouldnt be there,71,2014-11-06T13:11:41Z,0,1,ending,2

j3DuONZb3Ik,if youre looking for a more summarized verson of the reason why cooper left at the end in the new space craft he was going to edmunds planet to be with brand so they could populate the planet with th dimensional beings us humans irl of course are all dimensional being however a th dimensional being is basically a being that can move through time and cooper along with the audience finds out that he is murphs ghost and he was abasically altering the past to write the future before the past even happened the tesseract that cooper used to communicate with murph was created inside the black hole by the futre humans the th dimensional being that cooper now had to create so when cooper is on edmunds planet with brand they are creating the future th dimensional humans who would later create the tesseract going through time to make cooper go in it so he could give the people on earth the info to do the thing with gravity and so they can live again so cooper can go and repopulate so the th dimensional people can build the tesseract and it goes on and on in a loop essentially the entire reason cooper was in the tesseract in the blackhole in the first place is because of the th dimensional beings who exist in the past as well as the future but not in the present,12,2022-11-09T04:00:09Z,0,2,ending,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,the movie is wrong and also my favorite space scifi movie period i watched it at least a dozen times just by pleasure i got it for the first time anyway it presents a paradox future humans help present humans to find a new homeworld and avoid extermination remember there are no habitable planets that can be reached alive with the current technology and life on the earth will be over soon thats why future humans constructed a wormhole to facilitate present humans to travel to gargantua where there is one habitable planet so without the help of the future humans the present humans will perish soon but the problem is that if they die theyll never be future humans to help present humans you need something from a particular future for that future to happen and that is a classic bootstrap paradox anyway im deeply in love with this movie and ill keep watching it without overthinking it too much also hans zimmers music and those giant waves worth enduring a paradox even two,0,2020-06-13T15:47:35Z,0,2,ending,0

j3DuONZb3Ik,there is a time loop related to multidimensional space showing that in some circumstances physically related to intertwining of gravity and dimensions of spacetime you can show your attitude to some decisions made back in time and this will have caused some kind of anomalies in the key moment of decisionmaking the guy sees falling books and the information is stay however he decided to leave his kids and go into space nonetheless why this is just about that this guy will not have reconciled with the fact that he had gone into space and thus we have the anomaly in the context of now related to decisionmaking anomaly in a sense bound to closing the other way the parallel universe in which the consequences of staying would have occurred should he do it why dont we see such anomalies in any moment we make any decision probably this is due to our inability now or in the future to steer gravity in such a way to change our past and we cannot change our past because this would create some kind of inconsistency the chosen world in which due to our nonreconciliation with the previous decision we try to change our mind would have to collapse right away as other parallel universes do and so as for the world to not collapse in the currently being changed world there must appear an anomaly which of course will not cause the change the decision since as i muse this anomaly induces the collapse of parallel universes and thus the decision is irrevocable this would mean that there cannot exist parallel universes with parallel different decisions i think that even in the quantum sense however you never know hows with quantum mechanics such a statement would be true as it is with the schroedingers cat making a decision opening the bag with cat causes the alternative to collapse after opening the bag the cat cannot be both alive and dead by the way there is another movie which says about the irrevocability of a decision the matrix the oracle do you see her die neo no the oracle you have the sight now neo you are looking at the world without time neo then why cant i see what happens to her the oracle we can never see past the choices we dont understand neo are you saying i have to choose whether trinity lives or dies the oracle no youve already made the choice now you have to understand it neo but if you already know how can i make a choice the oracle because you didnt come here to make the choice youve already made it youre here to try to understand why you made it and i think there is actually no explanation to the ending of the interstellar we can just wonder about that,0,2020-03-31T18:39:05Z,0,2,ending,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,the movie gives us very little reason to think that the fivedimensional beings are future humans that possibility was completely baseless speculation by cooper there is no evidence whatsoever in the story that he is correct even if the wormhole builders are future humans we dont have a paradox if the eternalist view of time is correct and the movie clearly presumes that eternalism is indeed correct the future humans saving the present humans so that the present humans live long enough to become the future humans is an example of circular causality a causes b then b causes a then a causes b then b causes a and so on the thing is viewed from a fiveplus dimensional perspective the past the present and the future as we call them are all equally real and equally accessible from the fifth dimension event a and event b are basically simultaneous and are both visible on the time curve and here is the real important part there is no version of the time curve in which a and b do not exist no version of the time curve in which a does not cause b and no version in which b does not cause a there is no first play through in which the future did not yet exist to interact with the past according to eternalism the future and the past always exist are always just as real as the present and for five dimensional beings the unchanging past and the unchanging future are just as accessible as the present most scientists say that causality does not work like that and time travel is not possible a minority of scientists say causality does work like this and time travel is possible as long as the past is not changed obviously being a time travel story the movie went with the second explanation in short it might be a mind screw but it is not necessarily a paradox and while there are at least a dozen serious plot holes in this movie the way time travel is handled isnt one of them,0,2023-08-04T21:21:37Z,1,2,story and plot,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,it aims to be space odyssey and it becomes everything but stellar i was with the movie until the last act and then it became a simple dump fist fight flick what made space odyssey an epic is that people strive to be the best of mankind and not drowned in pointless recriminations and none sensible drama i am so tired of movies that keep propagating the belief that man is the problem to mankind another movie that did this same stupid plot twist was sunshine in addition thinking about anne hathaways roll she fails to deliver a female role model admirable of her convictions she crumbles when confronted with the consequences of her decisions all the while chastain though thorough and convincing not enough exposition was done about her to really appreciate her roll better i felt like that dimwhit of sandra bullocks role in gravity made its way into this flick along with her emotional basket case oh i need to be rescued by my charming prince blah i also would like to point out wes bentley died because he was a dump jack ass who got mesmerized by the gigantic wave his death was pointless and unnecessary i enjoy matt damon as an actor and im not saying hes doing a bad job at acting its just that his character is terrible the whole time i just kept counting the minutes before ambiguous evil dude was going to reveal himself finally we get to watch an intergalactic spacewrestling match between cooper and mann that involves head butts and flying booster rockets its a scene from a completely different movie and one that would have made more sense in armageddon actually dr mann is a lot like steve buscemis character from armageddon the formerly sane genius who starts blowing everything up for no reason he wants to go home but for the life of me i cant figure out what manns plan was supposed to be i dont consider this a plot hole instead i just hate this character everything about this sequence felt like it belonged in another movie seemed to last forever and made me actively hate a movie that i had been enjoying up until that point and then enjoyed again once mann was gone damon took mann from reasonable human being to nut job who wants to kill everyone in what seemed like seconds it reminded me of the last act of sunshine a poor narrative with a clich twist that gives the uncomprehending viewer no choice but to watch the vomitrocious disaster that it becomes nolan read this plot below this makes sense imagine this scenario prof brand and the nasa team are trying to figure out plan a but they cant solve the equation originally there is no wormhole and they are stuck on earth as the blight is happening brand sends a team of astronauts and robots on a ship and travel to gargantua without a wormhole it just takes hundreds of millions of years during this time they are in hibernation they finally arrive on the planet colonize and send a probe into the black hole that relays the data to solve plan a after a long enough time of living on gargantua they evolve into d beings and using the data from the probe in the black hole they create the wormhole since its d they can go back and change events time is not linear anymore they make the wormhole place it near saturn and then the events in the movie play out as we see them this way there is no longer a temporal paradox because the wormhole was not constructed out of thin air this fits well with the movies tagline mankind was born on earth it was never meant to die here originally mankind did die on planet earth except for the select few that made it to gargantua and colonized the remaining humans it was only after evolving into d beings that they could go back and prevent mankind from perishing on earth the tagline is alluding to this theory because mankind did originally die on earth but eventually they went back after evolving to prevent mankind from dying on earth in the first place,0,2014-11-19T23:12:31Z,0,1,acting and performances,0

BHsFzDON6pA,the main character of this movie is gargantua the supermassive rotating black hole it is the one that governs the fate of the astronauts and the worlds in its grasp creating a stage of warped spacetime upon which the movie takes place for the same reason it is said that darth vader is the main character of the original star wars trilogy even though luke is the protagonist everyone responds to vaders actions and choices in interstellar cooper is the protagonist murph is the deuteragonist and gargantua is vader where general relativity is literally its force everyone must obey the laws of physics and their influence through their manifestation of gargantua the black hole was not simply cgi they simulated it from the equations of general relativity which has never been done before in movie history all the bending of spacetime around it is depicted physically accurate and comes from the equations themselves im a gravitational physicist myself and i had a blast watching this movie because all the important physics is done correctly starting with no sound in space rarely done right over the black hole visuals the zerogravity physics the time dilation physics is only broken in places where it makes the journey itself happen such as safely passing the black hole landing on a high gravity world near the black hole starting from it via a small glider and so on these are incorrect but fall into the category of journeyenabling things and are broken by design not by mistake,453,2014-11-07T00:35:33Z,0,1,visual effects and CGI,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,i was wondering would it be possible for cooper to leave a message other than stay for murph and then i started wondering was it at the same time that the books fell off the shelves in as when cooper was pushing them off from the other side if yes then he would exist twice in time since he saw himself and tried to stop himself if no it wouldve been possible for him to send another message than stay which would totally mess up time since that was actually not possible so what the hell,0,2015-01-14T01:50:29Z,0,2,story and plot,0
BHsFzDON6pA,hannah gerry of course i dont mind it might surprise you that many things in this film are actually part of reality for example the black hole depicted in interstellar is as close to reality as humans probably will ever see now keep in mind that this is a sciencefiction film worm holes have not been discovered yet and i doubt they exist in real life and we have absolutely no idea what happens when an object passes the event horizon of the black hole apart from all the science in interstellar theres a lot of stuff in there thats just waaay out there the scenes with the tesseract in which cooper tries to communicate with murph are crazy and very bold i would love to get into every little detail but the comment section doesnt provide enough space if youre interested in this stuff watch the science of interstellar on youtube there are a lot of great documentaries about relativity and black holes aswell,21,2016-03-24T03:44:30Z,1,2,visual effects and CGI,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,am i the only one who feels this movie lacked all emotion and that the characters failed to behave like people at all the first hour and a half was so boring they refused to go into depth on any of the characters other then murph is smartest and greatest person in human history all puny humans bow to murph oh and side note he has a son as well now bow to murph puny humans bow to murph we didnt get any background or history on the blite that was killing all the crops they failed to explain why they couldnt just move underground and regrow them in green houses why they couldnt move to another planet like mars or even the moon move underground there and again regrow the crops in green houses and populate until they found a another earth through the worm hole they failed to mention what was going on in the rest of the world ie food riots wars civil and national etc other then that stupid little town that just happened to be sitting on top of nasa what luck derp this super sciencey movie failed to mention where the water for the mountain sized water waves came from there was only about feet of water on that planets surface right and if you stand on the beach when waves come in or know what a tidal wave or tsunami is you would know that all the water gets sucked out to form the tidal wave or tsunami but the water they were standing in did absolutely nothing not moving at all while giant water mountain waves just kept running along the surface on about three feet of water for reasons that is until they needed to kill off a useless character and the water suddenly moved to kill him on command again for reasons the videos sent to the astronauts by their families was the worst part of this movie in my opinion because it was a chance to add character development showing the kids grow up but yet again it had no emotion at all in years of messages all you see is his son send one video message in saying he met a girl one where he said they had a kid then a third where he says grandpas dead and we buried him with grandma and our baby in the back yard oh wait i didnt i tell you your grandson died yeah well he died anyway back to murph the awesome and all powerful isnt she great murph grows up to be a super smart awesome godlike human better then all puny humans but we dont see any of it in the video messages because even though she knows what her dad did risking his life to jet off into space trying to save humanity from extinction because shes super smart and awesome and she joined nasa left her home and her family to try and save humanity herself yet shes still mad at him and wont talk to her dad who risked him life by going off into space to save humanity or send him any messages because reasons theres so much more i could go into about the total lack of plot story line and character development but look at the special effects listen to that awesome soundtrack wow they said sciencey explainy stuff in this movie they said wormhole isnt that awesome what a great movie if murph dont solve some bullshite sciencey explainy gravity stuff then they cant build space stations or spaceships put people on them and send them into space but weve had space stations and space ships since the s they have space stations and space ships in this movie without all that gravity bullshit theyre already underground why cant they just place thousands of humans underground built more ships and keep going through the worm hole because murph awesome my daddy love me im his little girl he always send me money and buy me what i want im murph murph awesome this movie greatest movie ever so shut up and bow before murph all hail murph,0,2016-01-06T23:54:36Z,0,1,story and plot,0

BHsFzDON6pA,as a movie enthusiast and a huge nolan fan i was a little disappointed but very inspired i think nolan succeeded in what he wanted when i stepped out of the theater a lot of people were screaming in amazement everyone was just sotouched by it so awed and i think that was what really makes the movie for that reason i think it should be getting higher praise maybe not as a movie but definitely for what its trying to do however i dont think many critics and serious movie enthusiasts will get it because i feel like it was never meant to be the perfect movie we expected its meant to be a spark to something beyond a movie we were expecting a cinematic masterpiece when it was reaching for something else dont just think about the movie you saw think the future of the human race that or nolan was just not in his game p i would also like to say that just because you couldnt understand the science in the dialogue it doesnt make the movie bad one of the main goals of the movie was to present a scenario with as much accuracy as possible making its message about humans even more inspiring because its telling us that the amazing things we saw in the movie are very possible,1,2014-11-05T18:52:18Z,0,1,emotional impact,2

qhW1HfSuPVQ,the overall plot to the movie isnt that hard to follow but it plays a massive guessing game for the audience theres only ways that they are super humans who evolved from the near dying race of humans from coopers time the first is multiple parallel universes there may have been one universe off screen where somehow the humans survived and thousands of years passed by and they evolved into superhumans who then entered into a parallel universe for some unknown reasonand went back in time to help cooper on screen with the black hole and the tesseract the only other explanation is that its a time paradox a sort of chicken and egg situation where the super humans could be the humans that survived on cooper station at the end or they could be the embryos which brand saves and grows on her boyfriends planet but if either of these groups are the superhumans which helped cooper then it begs the question the only way they survive is because of the black hole which the superhumans put there and if one of these groups is the superhumans how do they put the black hole in space in the first place it becomes an infinite loop thus creating a paradox i personally didnt like the story of interstellar i felt it was to poorly written the cinematography and acting were excellent but the plot holes are just to major to get invested into the story its just as easy to say that some aliens could have just placed the black hole there because they wanted to help the humans for some unknown reason it makes as much sense as the other explanations,0,2015-01-25T04:54:24Z,0,2,story and plot,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,kaisalis i see the argument that you are presenting but it doesnt add up if humans do not survive long enough to progress to that stage attain that higher level of existence then we cant go back in time to ensure that we can as we never did in the first place and this is why it doesnt make sense that cooper brought himself there with manipulating the dust to give the coordinates of nasa the banging of the books of the shelf makes sense as does manipulating the watch in the movie plot but if he doesnt have the coordinates then he can never go to nasa and therefore never go to the library of time and bang some books off the shelf etc to say that we were always meant to get there and so we will to me doesnt reconcile the problem to me its like relying on food that your future self will eat to sustain you and saying that you no longer need to eat in the present as opposed to relying on the food that your past self has eaten when it was in the present which is now the past to sustain you is time linear im sure there are arguments for and against but we know that some people claim to have dreams that come true either in part or in full and i have no doubt in some cases used the dream as a warning if time is linear that shouldnt be possible,0,2020-04-12T06:01:23Z,1,2,story and plot,0

j3DuONZb3Ik,nooo guys youre not understanding christopher nolans maneuvers thats why hes the goat in mind bending movies such as inception coopers death started when he was floating in the space okay lets make things clearremember when matt damon said before trying to kill him last thing you will see before dying is your family youre beloved one pay attention here that was a hint for us when he decided to go through the black hole the gravitational pressure of a black hole is so strong that a human being couldnt survive in it without suffocating he made a choice there was nothing to lose cooper was already dead when he entered gargantua or close to dying in that case either the d sequence was only hallucinations or maybe he acted unconsciously cooper is in his ship heading straight for the black hole he sees light projections coming from ahead and begins to scream suddenly we shift back to his son tom on earth in front of the burning farm the scene cuts and were back in the cockpit where cooper regains consciousness after we guess he was out for a couple of minutes this when the film goes into nde neardeathexperience a phenomenon that humans experience while dying google it the fact that the bright lights disappeared as he woke up and the fact he lost consciousness before entering the black hole a geometric shape makes it all very possible now its up to you to decide the second clue is in the music playing during the space drifting scene just before it cuts hanz zimmer who delivers a masterful partition concludes his song what happens now with a high organ note that remains constant and lingers in time just like an hospitals electrocardiogram and its continuous sound when a heart stops beating nolan is known for writing lines that always have a deeper meaning that makes sense further in the story the lines are never just said for the sake of it as a matter of fact dr mann who played by matt damon tells cooper an intriguing fact about minutes earlier in the film the last thing you see before you die is your children five minutes later mann betrays cooper leaving him agonising on the glacier and asks him can you see your children now theyre with you right now while he escapes and brand attempts to save cooper he tries to remain conscious and pictures his last memory of murph from years before why is this line so important because if it comes up twice in the story even though it doesnt bring anything to the story there must be a reason behind it in the final act just before cooper really dies in space dr manns theory comes into place cooper imagines the life he wouldve had if he had been saved in time healed on a space station and finally reunited with an older murph on top of that who hasnt noticed that when he enters murphs hospital room the family members around the bed make space for cooper but he doesnt care for them we dont even really see their faces in the shot after two minutes with murph he retires the same way walking back and murphs grandchildren and his surround the bed again without paying attention to their great grandfather and hero youll also notice nolans craft in this shot cooper doesnt recognise his grandchildren and greatgrandchilden he imagines their physical presence but has no idea what they look like nor who they are and just like a dream he leave the room walking backwards as they come closer to murph since dr mann mentioned his childrenwhere his coopers son in the hospital scene well to begin with if he imagines his daughter years older its very likely cooper already imagines his son to be dead since he was older than murph secondly i think everyone who saw interstellar knows it by now cooper doesnt seem to care much for his son and when cooper was agonising on dr manns planet waiting for brands help he only pictures his daughter since their bond reflects coopers personality even if its a shame for poor tom tunnel tv and tars hmmm and please remind me what people who go through nde experience thats right they see a tunnel with a light at the end of it moreover the representations of this tunnel coincides with the images of interstellar scientists claims that people who go through nde they experience mystical things raised from body pleasant family the men that saved cooper on the station put the dysfunctional tars in coopers farm and it just seems very unlikely that from the point of view of the rescuers they would leave the robot to rust tars might be the only witness to all of what happened during the interstellar trip the stations engineers wouldve tried to work on the robot to collect valuable information especially since cooper manages to fix him using only a screwdriver if we follow our theory to the end and we consider nolans greatness once again tars waiting for cooper in his living room is only his visions that he imagines before dying finally one last odd thing in the films end and i think everyone noticed it the tvs in the station that plays in loop testimonies of life on earth from when coop lived there some of the extracts are used at the very beginning of the film too as shots within the story so yes you can suggest the tvs are here as a kind of memorial or that coopers recreated farm is like a museum which would explain the red ropes guiding cooper in the house when he enters but they also look like something out of a dream in fact at the very beginning of the film we hear the first testimony of an old lady saying my father was a farmer cooper is asleep as if he was just reliving his last moments on earth in his final visions but i understand this last point is a toughie to demonstrate even though i prefer to believe in this projection possibility theres one thing for sure with the films openending nolan allows us to imagine the possibilities just like he did in inception because look at the facts would a director that pays so much attention to every detail would be satisfied with this banal ending it could also be because his mainstream status asks of him to create this alternative simple ending but that actually hides with great subtlety the real ending to interstellar nolan used the nde phenomenon to let us see his imaginary thoughts that he was experiencing when went unconscious what a masterpiece,0,2020-03-30T20:05:47Z,0,2,ending,1

qhW1HfSuPVQ,i spent literally days coming up with a theory i was happy with i now have possible ones i think the beings arent humans at all and are just aliens in a way they helped the humans survive when coop says not yet but we will in reply to tars comment about humans not building the tesseract it could mean now that they survive and evolve they will become dimensional beings and making wormholes and such is possible not that they actually make it but they can a question is why do these aliens help the same question can be posed to why do we save animals from extinction maybe multiverse theory this one is a bit of a long shot but still viable i think referring to murphys law whatever can happen will happen is the building block for the planck scale infinite universe stuff basically branches of universes are made for each possible decision for example if i were to come up to a crossroad and take a right other universes will be branched off where i take a left etc what im getting at is a branch where the human race survives and evolves ultimately becoming d beings decides to save earth with the blight by traversing time as they can see it as a physical dimension the problem with this is why would they do it what is their motive the last theory is the most farfetched and in my opinion the least satisfactory one the infinite paradox who saved coop in the movie future humans did they would have had to survive in the first place to do so so who saved them future future humans lol and the cycle goes on the question is where does it start and how also who are they placing the wormhole for obviously for the humans but when as for the whole brands colonised humans on edmunds planet become the d beings is impossible someone needed to have placed the wormhole there in the first place otherwise the colony couldnt exist i hope these theories please remember they are theories have helped anyone who needed to know an answer,0,2014-11-20T12:12:24Z,0,2,ending,1

j3DuONZb3Ik,the only thing i dont understand is how they humanity survived in the first place to make the tesseract so she can have the data like the only way they could do that if it was like an parallel universe humanity who made the tesseract seeing this or i really dont get because its literally a paradox in the first place they just cannot do the tesseract without the info of the quantum world so the only way that could be stopped if it someone from another world like another universe did the tesseract so the paradox can be closed or in other words the paradox to be shift where it can be closed but idk what i am even saying is just too complicated like they will not even had to exist if it was not a paradox witch makes the idea that the only way to be closed if a parallel humanity did it so they can close it there or i dont know but i am more than sure that i am wrong in the first place so yea,1,2021-01-04T00:02:59Z,0,2,clarity and complexity,0

j3DuONZb3Ik,an awful movie that takes a simple tale and tangles it with trope puzzles in hopes that make it artificially deep love and survival feels ultimately contrived here and nolan again makes the audience go through long lulls to deliver an obvious ending sure we do need some explanation but ultimately we knew what was going to happen minutes in,0,2022-11-10T11:01:15Z,0,1,ending,0

j3DuONZb3Ik,first of all this is more of a synopsis than an explanation of the ending but i finally saw the movie this evening and the ending was a paradox so humanity lives on with murph being able to get everyone off the planet however the only way this could happen is if humanity they could have survived in the first place to create the wormhole to allow the endurance to find the planet and the only way to save humanity was to get the information from inside the black hole which there was no logistical way to do so with the exception of having th dimension capability far into the future however we would have never gotten that far in the first place as humanity would have perished i would have much preferred to be saved by an otherworldly race than ourselves in the future at least that would have made sense,0,2020-03-30T02:01:51Z,0,2,ending,1
